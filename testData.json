    "description": "# Save hours in Tock throughout the week \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTock is a simple time tracking app that 18F employees use to report their time on a weekly basis. The application also provides some light data visualization tools that allow users to look at what users have logged time to a project, as well as what projects to which a user has logged time.  This issue seeks to allow users to update their time cards throughout the week.\r\n\r\n## Auction rules \r\n\r\nRegistered users on micropurchase.18f.gov may bid to deliver the requirements in this auction. The lowest bidder at the time the auction closes shall receive the award. The awarded bidder shall have five business days after notice of award to deliver the requirements.
